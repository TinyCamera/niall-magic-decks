# Gishath, Sun's Avatar

**Color Identity:** Naya (Red/Green/White) | **Bracket:** 3 (Upgraded) | **Cards:** 100

## Theme

Ramp into an 8-mana dinosaur commander, swing with trample and haste, flip dinosaurs off the top of your library directly onto the battlefield. Every creature in the deck is a dinosaur to maximize Gishath's combat damage trigger.

## How It Plays

The early game is all ramp — Farseek, Cultivate, Kodama's Reach, and cost reducers like Kinjalli's Caller and Otepec Huntmaster aim to land Gishath by turn 4-5. Once Gishath connects (built-in trample and haste help), you reveal cards equal to the combat damage dealt and slam any dinosaurs you find onto the battlefield for free. Eladamri's Call finds the right dinosaur for the moment, and Congregation at Dawn stacks the top of your library before attacks for guaranteed hits. Boros Charm and Akroma's Will grant double strike, doubling the trigger. The dinosaurs themselves are massive — Zacama untaps your lands on ETB, Wakening Sun's Avatar wipes non-dinosaurs, and Apex Altisaur fights down opposing boards. Rhythm of the Wild gives everything haste or a counter, and The Great Henge costs just GG with Gishath's 7 power, drawing cards off every creature that follows.

## Key Cards

- **Congregation at Dawn** — put 3 dinosaurs on top of your library, then attack with Gishath to flip them all into play
- **Eladamri's Call** — instant-speed tutor for any creature to hand, finds whatever dinosaur the situation demands
- **Zacama, Primal Calamity** — untaps all your lands on ETB plus repeatable removal; the best thing to flip off Gishath
- **Regisaur Alpha** — gives all your dinosaurs haste, plus makes a 3/3 token
- **Boros Charm** — double strike on Gishath doubles the trigger (14 damage = 14 cards revealed)
- **Rhythm of the Wild** — haste or +1/+1 counter for every creature, and they can't be countered
- **The Great Henge** — costs GG with Gishath out, draws a card and gains life for every creature entering
- **Wakening Sun's Avatar** — one-sided board wipe on ETB, destroys all non-dinosaurs
