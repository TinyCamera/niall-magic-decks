# Seshiro the Anointed
**Color Identity:** Green | **Bracket:** 3 (Upgraded) | **Cards:** 100

## Theme
Mono-green Snake tribal. Go wide with snakes, draw cards off every combat damage trigger with Seshiro, and overwhelm with lords and finishers.

## How It Plays
Ramp early with Sakura-Tribe Elder, Cultivate, and mana snakes like Orochi Sustainer. Deploy Seshiro and start swinging — every snake that connects draws a card, and with +2/+2 across the board they hit hard. Sosuke in the 99 gives warriors a destroy-on-contact trigger for board control. Ohran Frostfang adds deathtouch and even more card draw. Build a critical mass of snakes, then close with Overwhelming Stampede, Triumph of the Hordes, or Beastmaster Ascension. Cobra Trap and Sosuke's Summons generate surprise boards of snake tokens, and Seed the Land rewards your ramp plan with even more bodies.

## Key Cards
- **Sosuke, Son of Seshiro** — snake lord in the 99; warriors destroy creatures on combat damage
- **Ohran Frostfang** — deathtouch and card draw on every attacker; redundant with Seshiro in the best way
- **Gaea's Cradle** — pays for itself immediately in a creature-heavy deck
- **Natural Order** — sacrifice a cheap snake to tutor any green bomb directly into play
- **Seedborn Muse** — untaps everything on each opponent's turn; enables Orochi Hatchery and Chord of Calling
- **Champion of Lambholt** — makes your snakes unblockable as she grows from each creature entering
- **Cobra Trap** — four snakes at instant speed for one green mana when the condition is met
- **Collected Company** — most of your creatures are 3 CMC or less, making CoCo very reliable

## Bracket Notes
3 Game Changers: Gaea's Cradle, Seedborn Muse, Natural Order. No mass land denial. Scurry Oak + Ivy Lane Denizen is a 2-card combo but requires 6+ total mana to assemble, so it won't resolve before turn 6 under normal conditions.
