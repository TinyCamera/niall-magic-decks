# Minn, Wily Illusionist
**Color Identity:** Blue | **Bracket:** 3 (Upgraded) | **Cards:** 100

## Theme
Illusion tribal with card draw synergy. Minn creates 1/1 illusion tokens whenever you draw your second card each turn, and when those illusions die, you cheat permanents from your hand onto the battlefield. Draw cards, make illusions, sacrifice them, drop bombs.

## How It Plays
The early game is mana rocks and cantrips — Sol Ring, Mind Stone, Ponder, Preordain. Deploy Minn on turn 3-4, then start the draw engine: Rhystic Study, Mystic Remora, Teferi's Ageless Insight. Each extra draw makes an illusion token. Skullclamp on a 1/1 illusion draws two more cards and triggers Minn's death ability, letting you drop a permanent with mana value equal to the illusion's power (buffed by Lord of the Unreal). Ashnod's Altar and Altar of Dementia give you sacrifice outlets at will. Spark Double copying Minn doubles the token generation. Coastal Piracy and Kindred Discovery keep the cards flowing when illusions connect or enter. The deck wins through accumulated value — cheat big permanents, bounce the board with Cyclonic Rift, and grind opponents out.

## Key Cards
- **Lord of the Unreal** — +1/+1 and hexproof to all illusions. Pumps tokens so Minn's death trigger cheats bigger permanents.
- **Skullclamp** — Equip to a 1/1 illusion: it dies, you draw 2, Minn triggers. The deck's best engine piece.
- **Spark Double** — Copies Minn. Two Minns means two illusion tokens per draw trigger.
- **Phantasmal Dragon** — 5/5 flyer for 4 mana. Real illusion tribal that hits hard.
- **Ghostly Pilferer** — Draws cards when opponents cast from non-hand zones (common in Commander), and is itself a discard outlet.
- **Amphin Mutineer** — Removal stapled to an illusion body. Exiles a creature, opponent gets a vanilla 4/3.
- **Teferi's Ageless Insight** — Doubles card draws. One Brainstorm becomes draw 6. Exponential with Minn triggers.
- **Ashnod's Altar** — Sacrifice illusions for mana, triggering Minn's permanents-from-hand ability at will.

## Bracket Notes
**Game Changers (3/3):** Cyclonic Rift, Rhystic Study, Mystic Remora.

**Rule 0 flag:** Back to Basics — punishes greedy mana bases while mono-blue is unaffected. Legal at bracket 3 but worth mentioning.

No 2-card combos before turn 6. No mass land denial. The deck wins through incremental value over turns 6-10, not degenerate combos.
