# Kokusho, the Evening Star

**Color Identity:** Mono-Black | **Bracket:** 3 (Upgraded) | **Cards:** 100

## Theme

Kokusho worship. We sacrifice our dragon spirit over and over, draining the table every time he dies and reanimating him to do it again. He dies, he comes back, everyone suffers.

## How It Plays

Ramp to 6 mana and cast Kokusho. Hold up a 1-mana save spell (Supernatural Stamina, Feign Death, Undying Malice, etc.) and sacrifice him to a free outlet like Viscera Seer or Phyrexian Tower. The death trigger drains 5 from each opponent, the save spell brings him right back, and you do it again next turn. Soldevi Adnate is secretly the best card in the deck — sacrifice Kokusho to it, get 6 black mana plus the death trigger, then reanimate him with the mana you just made. Damage multipliers like Drivnod (doubles death triggers), Bloodletter of Aclazotz (doubles life loss), and Wound Reflection (doubles again at end step) make each sacrifice devastating. Devouring Greed lets you sacrifice Kokusho as part of casting it — his death trigger plus the Greed drain hits for 9 per opponent.

## Key Cards

- **Soldevi Adnate** — sac Kokusho for 6 black mana + death trigger, then reanimate with the mana
- **Drivnod, Carnage Dominus** — doubles Kokusho's death trigger (10 per opponent instead of 5)
- **Bloodletter of Aclazotz** — doubles all life loss opponents take on your turn
- **Wound Reflection** — doubles life loss again at end of turn
- **Mikaeus, the Unhallowed** — gives Kokusho undying for one free reanimate per cycle
- **Goryo's Vengeance** — instant-speed reanimate for a legendary spirit, sac before exile
- **Devouring Greed** — sac spirits (including Kokusho) for a massive drain

## Bracket Notes

- **Game Changers:** 0 (3 allowed)
- No 2-card infinite combos — Nim Deathmantle loops require 3+ pieces, Mikaeus gives one free undying but no counter removal for infinite
- No mass land denial
