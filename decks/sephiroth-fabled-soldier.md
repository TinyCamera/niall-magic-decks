# Sephiroth, Fabled SOLDIER
**Color Identity:** Black | **Bracket:** 3 (Upgraded) | **Cards:** 100

## Theme
Aristocrats sacrifice engine that transforms Sephiroth by cycling creatures through death triggers, generating card advantage and draining opponents' life totals.

## How It Plays
The deck generates expendable tokens and recursive creatures to fuel Sephiroth's transformation trigger, requiring four creature deaths in a single turn. Once transformed into One-Winged Angel, Sephiroth creates a permanent emblem that drains opponents for every creature death while enabling massive card draw through sacrifice. The strategy leverages classic aristocrats payoffs like Blood Artist and Zulaport Cutthroat alongside powerful sacrifice outlets (Phyrexian Altar, Ashnod's Altar) to control the board while building an overwhelming life total advantage.

## Key Cards

**Bitterblossom** - Provides consistent token generation each upkeep to fuel sacrifice engines and transformation triggers.

**Phyrexian Altar / Ashnod's Altar** - Free sacrifice outlets that convert creatures into mana, enabling explosive turns and transformation.

**Gravecrawler** - Infinitely recursive sacrifice fodder that can be cast from the graveyard as long as you control a zombie.

**Blood Artist / Zulaport Cutthroat** - Core drain engines that trigger on every creature death, multiplying the value from Sephiroth's emblem.

**Skullclamp** - Transforms token creatures into card advantage, particularly powerful after Sephiroth transforms.

**Dictate of Erebos / Grave Pact** - Forces opponents to sacrifice creatures whenever you do, controlling the board while triggering your drain effects.

**Pitiless Plunderer** - Converts every creature death into Treasure tokens, providing mana acceleration and artifact sacrifice triggers.

**Warren Soultrader** - Powerful sacrifice outlet that generates Treasure tokens, enabling both mana and card advantage loops.

## Bracket Notes
**Game Changers:** 1 (Demonic Tutor)

**Rule 0 Considerations:** Grave Pact and Dictate of Erebos can create oppressive board states where opponents struggle to maintain creatures. Bolas's Citadel may lead to extended turns. Players should discuss tolerance for these effects before the game.
