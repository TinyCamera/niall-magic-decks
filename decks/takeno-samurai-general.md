# Takeno, Samurai General
**Color Identity:** White | **Bracket:** 3 (Upgraded) | **Cards:** 100

## Theme
Samurai tribal with bushido synergy. Takeno turns every bushido samurai into a serious combat threat — Konda alone becomes a 13/13 in combat. Fill the board with honorable warriors, suit them up with legendary Kamigawa equipment, and swing for lethal.

## How It Plays
Deploy cheap samurai in the early turns while ramping with Sol Ring, Arcane Signet, and Smothering Tithe. Sensei Golden-Tail can grant bushido to non-samurai creatures, extending Takeno's buff. Once Takeno hits the board, your 2/2s become 3/3s that grow to 4/4s in combat — and Konda becomes a 13/13 monster. Brave the Sands gives vigilance so you can attack and still block with massive bushido triggers. True Conviction and Akroma's Will close games fast. Masako the Humorless lets your tapped attackers still block, and Rune-Tail prevents damage to your creatures once you're at high life.

## Key Cards
- **Konda, Lord of Eiganjo** — Bushido 5 means Takeno gives him a static +5/+5, making him an 8/8 that becomes 13/13 in combat. Indestructible.
- **Sensei Golden-Tail** — Grants bushido 1 to any creature, extending Takeno's anthem to your entire board.
- **Inner-Chamber Guard** — Bushido 2 for just 1W. With Takeno, a 2/4 that becomes 6/8 in combat.
- **Oathkeeper, Takeno's Daisho** — Flavor home run. Equipped samurai gets +3/+1, and if it dies, it comes back. Legendary synergy with Takeno.
- **Smothering Tithe** — Mono-white's best ramp engine. Powers out Takeno and refuels after board wipes.
- **Masako the Humorless** — Your tapped attackers can still block, turning bushido into a defensive nightmare for opponents.
- **True Conviction** — Double strike with lifelink on a board of pumped samurai ends games immediately.
- **Flowering of the White Tree** — Efficient anthem that also gives legendary creatures ward 1, protecting Takeno.
