# Omnath, Locus of Rage

**Color Identity:** Gruul (Red/Green) | **Bracket:** 3 (Upgraded) | **Cards:** 107 (built for MPC printing)

## Theme

Landfall aggro. Every land that enters the battlefield creates a 5/5 Elemental, and when those Elementals die, they bolt any target. The deck ramps relentlessly to trigger Omnath as many times as possible per turn.

## How It Plays

Spend the early game ramping with spells like Cultivate, Kodama's Reach, and Nature's Lore to hit Omnath on curve. Once the commander is down, every land drop makes a 5/5. Cards like Azusa, Exploration, and Oracle of Mul Daya let you play multiple lands per turn, flooding the board with Elementals. Scapeshift and Splendid Reclamation create massive burst turns. Perilous Forays turns each Elemental into a fetch effect (sac for a land, trigger another Elemental). Warstorm Surge and Where Ancients Tread add direct damage on top of the token army. Even board wipes work in your favor since dying Elementals deal 3 damage each.

## Key Cards

- **Scapeshift** — sacrifice lands to fetch a pile of basics, creating a wave of 5/5s all at once
- **Perilous Forays** — sac an Elemental (dealing 3 on death) to fetch a land (making a new 5/5), repeatable engine
- **Avenger of Zendikar** — plant tokens that grow with every landfall, a second axis of token pressure
- **Ancient Greenwarden** — doubles all landfall triggers, including Omnath's
- **Azusa, Lost but Seeking** — three land drops per turn means three 5/5s per turn
- **Splendid Reclamation** — returns all lands from graveyard to battlefield, devastating after Scapeshift
- **Warstorm Surge** — each 5/5 Elemental deals 5 damage on entry

## Bracket Notes

- **Game Changers:** 1 (Crop Rotation)
- From the Ashes replaces nonbasic lands with basics (soft mass land denial) — worth a Rule 0 mention
- Exploration and Scapeshift are not on the Game Changers list
