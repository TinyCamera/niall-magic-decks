# Magda, Brazen Outlaw

**Color Identity:** Red | **Bracket:** 3 (Upgraded) | **Cards:** 100

## Theme

Dwarves building crazy things. Dwarves tap to generate Treasures, which fuel Magda's activated ability to tutor any artifact or dragon directly onto the battlefield.

## How It Plays

Deploy Magda early, then flood the board with cheap dwarves and vehicles to tap them for Treasure tokens. Once you have five Treasures, sacrifice them through Magda to search up a game-ending artifact like Portal to Phyrexia or a dragon like Drakuseth. Clock of Omens and artifact creatures enable repeated tapping without attacking. The deck can grind value through Treasure synergy pieces or close games fast with a well-timed tutor into a haymaker.

## Key Cards

- **Magda, the Hoardmaster** — second Magda effect that doubles the Treasure engine
- **Clock of Omens** — tap artifacts to untap dwarves, enabling Treasure loops
- **Roaming Throne** — doubles Magda's triggered ability for extra Treasures per tap
- **Maskwood Nexus** — makes every creature a Dwarf, turning the whole board into Treasure generators
- **Drakuseth, Maw of Flames** — top-end tutor target that removes threats on attack
- **Portal to Phyrexia** — artifact tutor target that wipes the board and reanimates
- **Xorn** — extra Treasure on every Treasure creation
- **Professional Face-Breaker** — converts Treasures into card advantage

## Bracket Notes

- **Game Changers:** 0
- Clock of Omens + artifact dwarf needs Magda on board too, making it a 3-card combo realistic around turn 5-6+
- Blood Moon changes land types but does not destroy lands — no mass land denial
