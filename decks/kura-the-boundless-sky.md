# Kura, the Boundless Sky
**Color Identity:** Green | **Bracket:** 3 (Upgraded) | **Cards:** 100

## Theme
Tooth and Nail homage — massive mono-green ramp into Eldrazi titans and green bombs. Kura dies to tutor Tron lands, utility lands, or whatever you need, then Life from the Loam and Crucible of Worlds keep the land engine cycling. Hit critical mana, slam an Eldrazi, end the game.

## How It Plays
Early turns: play ramp creatures (Sakura-Tribe Elder, Lotus Cobra, Azusa) and land-tutoring spells (Sylvan Scrying, Expedition Map, Crop Rotation) to assemble Tron or just flood the board with lands. Kura is a 4/4 flying deathtoucher that demands an answer — and when it dies, you tutor 3 lands to hand or make a massive Spirit token. Mid-game you're casting Tooth and Nail entwined, Natural Order sacrificing a mana dork into Ulamog, or just hard-casting Eldrazi off 12+ mana. Life from the Loam + cycling lands (Tranquil Thicket) and sacrifice lands (Strip Mine, Zuran Orb) keeps the card/land flow going. Ancient Greenwarden and Ramunap Excavator let you replay lands from the graveyard for extra value.

## Key Cards
- **Tooth and Nail** — the namesake. Entwined, tutor two Eldrazi and put them onto the battlefield.
- **Life from the Loam** — recurring land engine. Gets back Tron pieces, Strip Mine, cycling lands.
- **Kozilek, Butcher of Truth** / **Ulamog, the Ceaseless Hunger** / **Ulamog, the Infinite Gyre** — the Eldrazi payoffs. Annihilator, exile, card draw.
- **Crop Rotation** — instant-speed land tutor. Find the missing Tron piece, Eye of Ugin, or Nykthos.
- **Natural Order** — sac a Sakura-Tribe Elder, get any green creature (or colorless via the battlefield).
- **Crucible of Worlds** — replay Strip Mine every turn, recover from land destruction.
- **Selvala, Heart of the Wilds** — enormous mana generation with your big creatures.
- **Eye of Ugin** — tutor Eldrazi to hand, reduce their cost by 2.

## Bracket Notes
3 Game Changers: Crop Rotation, Natural Order, Ancient Tomb. No mass land denial. No 2-card combos before turn 6. Tooth and Nail costs 9 mana (entwined) so it naturally resolves turn 6+ at earliest. Strip Mine is single-target removal, not mass LD.
