# The First Sliver
**Color Identity:** Five-Color (WUBRG) | **Bracket:** 3 (Upgraded) | **Cards:** 100

## Theme
Cascade Sliver tribal aggro. Cast Slivers, cascade into more Slivers, stack shared abilities, and overwhelm the table with an ever-growing hive.

## How It Plays
Ramp in the early turns with mana rocks and land-fetching sorceries. Deploy cheap Slivers that fix mana (Gemhide, Manaweft) and grant evasion or protection (Crystalline, Galerider). Once The First Sliver hits the battlefield, every Sliver you cast cascades into another, chaining abilities across the board. The deck wins through combat — lords like Sinew Sliver, Predatory Sliver, and Muscle Sliver stack +1/+1 buffs, while Bonescythe Sliver and Shifting Sliver make damage unblockable and doubled. Coat of Arms and Sliver Legion provide explosive one-turn kills. Descendants' Path gives a free Sliver off the top each upkeep, and Synapse Sliver keeps your hand full as the hive connects in combat.

## Key Cards
- **Cloudshredder Sliver** — Flying and haste for 2 mana. The best opening Sliver after mana dorks.
- **Crystalline Sliver** — Shroud on all Slivers makes targeted removal nearly impossible.
- **Sliver Legion** — Each Sliver gets +1/+1 for every other Sliver you control. Turns a wide board into lethal.
- **Bonescythe Sliver** — Double strike on every Sliver. Doubles the impact of every lord and pump effect.
- **Synapse Sliver** — Draw a card whenever any Sliver deals combat damage. Keeps the hand stocked.
- **Kindred Discovery** — Draw a card whenever a Sliver enters or attacks. Fuels the cascade engine.
- **Coat of Arms** — Every Sliver pumps every other Sliver. 10 Slivers means each gets +9/+9.
- **Descendants' Path** — Reveal the top card each upkeep; if it's a Sliver, cast it for free (with cascade).

## Bracket Notes
0 Game Changers. No infinite combos. No mass land denial.

**Rule 0 considerations:** Crystalline Sliver gives shroud to all Slivers, severely limiting opponents' ability to interact with the board. Coat of Arms can create one-shot kills with a wide enough board. Both are bracket-legal but worth mentioning pre-game.
